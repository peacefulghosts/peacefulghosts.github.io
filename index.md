## The Project:

These four Peaceful Ghosts are part of an initial edition of 10 hand-made NFTs aimed at bringing spiritual wellness initiatives into the blockchain ecosystem. Peaceful Ghosts are friendly ghosts, different from the specters that haunt most people: greed, anxiety, boredom, anger, fear. They are the source of ease and clarity and all the qualities that make life a joy to live. Normally they live out their days unnoticed in our minds, but now they are making an appearance on the NEAR blockchain.

These first 10 NFTs are part of a proof-of-concept for a future programmatically generated NFT collection of Peaceful Ghosts that will be a part of a blockchain community building and spiritual wellness initiative. This project is supporting the United Nations SDG Agenda 2030 for good health and well-being.
